    <h4> <u> DESCRIPTION - The Official Ferrari Magazine Issue 57 - 2022 Yearbook </u> </h4> 
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">The 2022 Ferrari Yearbook boasts four celebratory covers, each one dedicated to a different facet of the Prancing Horse: from the Purosangue, a new entry in the GT range, to the F1-75 single-seater that competed in both constructors’ and drivers’ titles – ranking second with Leclerc – in the F1 World Championship. And, further, to the 499P, the hypercar that will make its debut at the 2023 World Prototype Championship, as well as to the fashion collection showcased throughout the Milan fashion weeks.


The yearbook comprises all sports and corporate events held in 2022, a symbolic year celebrating Ferrari’s 75th anniversary. As well as the iconic models shown on the four rigid covers, its pages retrace the most significant moments in Ferrari history through a photo gallery featuring Ferrari star protagonists, an exclusive interview with Chief Executive Officer Benedetto Vigna and a sequence illustrating the special events dedicated to customers. It’s an invite to explore the Ferrari universe in all its guises, from its several Cavalcades to the Tributes to Targa Florio and the Mille Miglia races, with the 296 GTS on the roads of Friuli Venezia Giulia, the 296 G3 on the Barcelona track and the triumph of the 488 GTE in the FIA WEC LMGTE Pro class. Also including the Ferrari Driver Academy’s young drivers, besides those from the Esports Championship, and up to the great party that closed the Challenge Season and the Attività Sportive GT, along with the Finali Mondiali races in Imola.</p>
